<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a third-year Master's Student at the School of Data Science and Engineering, East China Normal University, under the supervision of Prof. Ming Gao and [Prof. Xiang Li](https://lixiang3776.github.io/) in the X101 lab. I am currently a research intern at Shanghai AI LAB, supervised by [Dr. Zhiyong Wu](https://lividwo.github.io/zywu.github.io/).

My research interests include:
- **AI Agents:** Multi-Agent, OS Agent, GUI Agent, GUI o1;
- **Scientific Review:** automated peer reviewing, review completion;
- **LLMs:** inference tuning, domain foundation model, knowledge editing, PEFT.

<!-- My research interests include data mining, especially graph mining. The research work I have been involved in encompasses heterogeneous graph mining and weakly supervised learning on graphs. -->
<!-- Currently I am exploring the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). -->
